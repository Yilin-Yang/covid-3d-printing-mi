# Flexspirator ‚Äì Usage and Care

<img src="https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/Yilin-Yang/covid-3d-printing-mi/master/images/flexspirator_no_callouts.png" width=50% />

The "Flexspirator" is a Maker-made reusable respirator that _should_ provide
N100 protection, **though it has not been formally tested and certified by
NIOSH.** It passes a self-administered [OSHA 1910.134 App A "Irritant Smoke"
qualitative fit test.](https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.134AppA)

The Flexspirator is designed to be worn daily by members of the general
population, to _protect_ themselves and others from COVID-19. It is intended to
be worn _instead_ of a regular cloth face mask or surgical mask, and should
offer strictly better protection.

## Motivation

Medical workers wear N95 respirators (or better) when treating COVID patients;
these protect them from contracting COVID-19 by inhaling coronavirus particles.
The N95 respirator filters the coronavirus particles out of the air they
inhale. If the respirator does not have an exhalation valve, then it will
_also_ filter coronavirus particles out of the air that the wearer _exhales_ as
well.

[**N95 respirators have been in shortage since the start of the pandemic.**](https://www.propublica.org/article/expired-respirators-reused-masks-nurses-in-the-nations-original-covid-19-epicenter-offer-sobering-accounts-of-what-could-come)
Standard medical practice is for medical workers to wear a disposable N95
respirator while treating a sick patient, and for them to _throw away_ that
respirator before treating another patient. Now, medical workers frequently
reuse the same "single-use" N95 respirator for days or weeks on end.

[As of October 27th,](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/27/3m-making-more-n95-masks-than-ever-as-covid-cases-rise.html)
current CDC guidelines ask that members of the general public do not purchase
N95 masks for their own day-to-day use, and instead wear cloth face masks
and/or surgical masks. This is to preserve the supply of disposable N95
respirators for frontline medical workers.

It is still probably unreasonable to expect the general public _not_ to seek
out respirators. As of November 13th, the American health care system is on the
verge of [nationwide collapse](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/11/third-surge-breaking-healthcare-workers/617091/)
due to uncontrolled COVID outbreaks across all 50 states. Members of the
general public should start wearing respirators: both to help protect
themselves from COVID-19 infection, and to reduce the resulting burden on the
nationwide health care system.

The Flexspirator is intended to help fill this gap. It has not been NIOSH
certified, and probably cannot be issued to actual healthcare workers without
violating OSHA regulations, but members of the general public can wear one
_voluntarily,_ and they should be protected from COVID-19 by doing so.

## Basic Construction

The Flexspirator is a slightly modified [Maker Mask Rapid](https://www.makermask.com/rapid-360.html) (MMR)
printed from [clear PETG](https://www.amazon.com/OVERTURE-Filament-Transparent-Multipack-Dimensional/dp/B08344S1TT)
reinforced with a strong, flexible, rubberized coating of [Swift Response's Flex Seal
Liquid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NygbA9UYPw), the easy way to coat,
seal, and stop leaks fast. It's the super thick rubber that you can pour right
into cracks to stop COVID dead in its tracks.

Flex Seal starts out as a thick liquid and turns into a super strong flexible
rubber. Dipping 3D printed MMRs creates an airtight seal that lasts for years.
This rubberized coating blocks ingress of contaminated air through [cracks and
holes in the plastic mask frame](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202006.0080/v1)
produced as artifacts of the [FDM printing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fused_filament_fabrication)
process.

In extreme heat or cold, Flex Seal Liquid keeps its hold.

<details>

‚ö†DO NOT EXPOSE A FLEXSPIRATOR TO PROLONGED TEMPERATURES OF GREATER THAN 65
DEGREES CELSIUS (149 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT).‚ö†
</summary>

A rough lower bound for the [glass transition temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass_transition)
of PETG plastic is 67 degrees Celsius, [according to Wikipedia.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene_terephthalate)

Heating a Flexspirator past the PETG glass transition temperature will probably
cause the plastic to warp and deform.
</details>

Unlike thin paints, Flex Seal Liquid is **ùï§ùï¶ùï°ùïñùï£ ùï•ùïôùïöùïîùïú** and creates a flexible
barrier that's _completely_ airtight. It's like a handyman, in a can!

Flex Seal Liquid is safe aroud plants and animals, so we used it to seal these
Flexspirators.

**Now with any COVID outbreak, big or small ‚Äì Flex Seal shuts out aerosols!**

To show you the incredible sealing power of Flex Seal Liquid, we made an entire
respirator out of 3D printed PETG plastic, and covered it in Flex Seal Liquid.

After a day of creating irritant smoke clouds, and deliberately huffing them
while wearing a Flexspirator, Flex Seal's airtight barrier takes a beating; and
the HEPA filter, cut from an [ordinary replacement HEPA filter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BWYNZV4/)
for a home air purfiier, stays filtrationally effective.

The inside will not be completely dry, because your breath will tend to
condense on the Flexspirator's inner surface.

<details>
<summary>
‚ö†LIMIT OR AVOID STRENUOUS PHYSICAL ACTIVITY WHILE WEARING A FLEXSPIRATOR.‚ö†
</summary>

Physical activity such as intense aerobic exercise requires heavy breathing.
Your breath carries moisture; too much may soak and moisten the HEPA filter
media, and cause it to clog; this will make breathing difficult or impossible,
and may or may not irreparably damage the filter.

If the activity cannot be avoided, be prepared to "hot-swap" the filter
cartridge if it clogs.

## Basic Usage

### Parts and Components

![Flexspirator parts](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/Yilin-Yang/covid-3d-printing-mi/master/images/flexspirator_parts.png)

The **Top Strap** and **Bottom Strap** secure the Flexspirator against your
face. They can be adjusted by pulling the ends of each strap through the
Slide Buckle, the Loop Buckle, or the Hook Buckle.

The **Hook Buckle** and the **Loop Buckle** on the Bottom Strap fasten
together behind your neck when you don the Flexspirator. This mimics the design
of a conventional reusable elastomeric respirator.

The **Mask Body** is the larger Flexspirator facepiece. It is comprised of
a stiff mask frame of PETG plastic coated on both its interior and exterior
with a silicone rubber coating of Flex Seal Liquid.

The **Edge Lining** is the edge of the Flexspirator facepiece where it
contacts your face. It is comprised of [vinyl weather stripping](https://www.homedepot.com/p/M-D-Building-Products-1-2-in-x-17-ft-White-Vinyl-Gasket-Weatherstrip-78394/100193598)
coated with Flex Seal Liquid; the weather stripping is soft and can conform to
the wearer's face, while the silicone rubber Flex Seal coating _significantly_
improves its seal against bare skin.

The **Filter Slot** is the hole into which the Filter Tray is placed. The space
between the Filter Tray and the Filter Slot (not labeled) is the
**Cartridge/Slot Interface**; this must be filled with a **Cartridge/Slot
Interface Sealant**, such as petroleum jelly applied to the outer edge of the
Filter Tray, to prevent contaminated air from flowing around and bypassing the
filter media.

The **Filter Tray** houses the **Filter Media**, which actually filters air.
The Filter Media is compressed flush against the walls of the Filter Tray by
a plastic **Retaining Ring**. Without this Retaining Ring, the Filter Media may
lift and curl away from the walls of the Filter Tray, creating air gaps, which
may allow contaminated air to bypass the Filter Media.

The **Locking Dimple** is a small divot in the front of the Mask Body. There is
a small protrusion (not labeled) on the Filter Cover that seats into the
Locking Dimple when the Filter Cover is screwed onto the Filter Tray, helping
to lock the Filter Cover into place.

### Protection Offered

**The Flexspirator _should_ offer protection comparable to a reusable N100
respirator.**

This is better than the protection offered by an N95 respirator
and should be sufficient to protect the wearer from inhaling coronavirus
particles while properly worn.

It should also protect the wearer from inhaling any sort of fine particulates,
including smoke, sawdust, metal swarf (from grinding tools), and tear gas.

This is not the same _type_ of protection as offered by a respirator equipped
with (e.g.) P100 + activated carbon filters. Oily aerosols may destroy the
Flexspirator's HEPA filter, rendering it ineffective at filtration. The HEPA
filter will also not absorb chemical fumes, such as from spraypaint or Flex
Seal.

### Maintenance

Protect the Flexspirator from damage so that it can still maintain an
airtight seal against the wearer's face when worn.

The seal may be compromised by:

1. _Physical damage to_ OR _manufacturing defects in_ the plastic mask frame,
resulting in micro- or macro-scale cracks and holes.
2. _Peeling_ or _perforation_ of the Flex Seal coating.
3. _Pinhole leaks_ in the _filter cartridge/slot sealant_, which may allow air to
bypass the HEPA filter media by passing between the filter tray and the filter
slot.

Even the plastic mask frame should be largely airtight by
itself. This creates protective redundancy: both (1) and (2) must occur at the
same spot on the mask's surface for the walls of the mask to spring a leak.
To check for such leaks, conduct an **Integrity Test** as described below.

#### Avoiding Structural Damage to the Plastic Mask Body

The Flexspirator is reasonably durable and will comfortably survive _ordinary_
rough handling, but extreme mishandling can snap, break, or deform the
underlying plastic mask frame. **Forms of mishandling that may break the plastic
mask body include:**

- Stepping on a Flexspirator _with_ your body weight
- Striking a Flexspirator sharply with a claw hammer
- Stowing a Flexspirator in a cramped book bag with heavy textbooks
- Exposing a Flexspirator to prolonged temperatures over 65 degrees Celsius
(149 degrees Fahrenheit)

The following will **probably NOT cause structural damage** to a
Flexspirator:

- Hurling a Flexpirator into a drywall from five meters distance
- Crashing face-first into a sliding glass door while wearing a Flexspirator

#### Avoiding Damage to the Flex Seal Coating

Flex Seal Liquid costs around $90 per gallon. Based on preliminary estimates,
it takes approximately $5 of Flex Seal Liquid to coat a Flexspirator. The
coating is made as thin as possible to maximize the number of Flexspirators
that can be constructed from a single bucket of Flex Seal Liquid; and for
cosmetic reasons, like avoiding bubbles and blobs.

The coating of cured Flex Seal Liquid will most likely peel and rip:

- Near the edges of the coating, where the cured Flex Seal gives way to
uncovered plastic.
- On the surface of the flexible vinyl weather stripping; too much
deformation of the weather stripping can overstress the Flex Seal and make it
tear.

The Flex Seal coating will **probably be damaged** by:

- Scraping with a metal fork or knife
- Scraping the Flexspirator against an abrasive surface with pressure, as by
forcibly scrubbing the Flexspirator against a bare brick wall

The Flex Seal coating will **probably _NOT_ be damaged** by:

- Rubbing or picking with your hands, unless you are picking at existing tears
or the edges of the coating
- Scrubbing with the scouring pad of a kitchen sponge, even one that isn't safe
for non-stick pans
- Rubbing against the spiral metal ring binding of a loose-leaf notebook while
in a book bag

#### Maintaining the Filter Cartridge/Slot Sealant

Imprecision in the process of 3D printing would prevent a perfect airtight seal
at the Cartridge/Slot Interface, i.e. between the plastic of the Filter Slot
and the Filter Tray. Without that seal, contaminated air may flow _around_ the
Filter Tray, bypassing the Filter Media entirely. We apply a Cartridge/Slot
Interface Sealant to fill these air gaps. In principle, many materials could be
used as Sealant, but we recommend common household petroleum jelly.

Gaps in the petroleum jelly Sealant may permit contaminated air to bypass the
Filter Media. This risk can be cheaply mitigated by applying _generous_ amounts
of petroleum jelly as Sealant, increasing the volume of jelly that would need
to be displaced to produce a leak.

You can apply a coating of Cartridge/Slot Interface Sealant simply by smearing
_generous_ quantities of petroleum jelly on the edges of a Filter Tray with
a Q-tip. As you press the Filter Tray into the Filter Slot, petroleum jelly
should squeeze out from the Cartridge/Slot Interface.
