# Flexspirator ‚Äì Usage and Care

*Past versions of this page are visible in its [History](https://github.com/Yilin-Yang/covid-3d-printing-mi/commits/master/flexspirator.md).*

<img src="https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/Yilin-Yang/covid-3d-printing-mi/master/images/flexspirator_no_callouts.png" />

The "Flexspirator" is a Maker-made reusable respirator that _should_ provide
N100 protection, **though it has not been formally tested and certified by
NIOSH.** It passes a self-administered [OSHA 1910.134 App A "Irritant Smoke"
qualitative fit test.](https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.134AppA)

The Flexspirator is designed to be worn daily by members of the general
population, to _protect_ themselves and others from COVID-19. It is intended to
be worn _instead_ of a regular cloth face mask or surgical mask, and should
offer strictly better protection.

## Motivation

Medical workers wear N95 respirators (or better) when treating COVID patients;
these protect them from contracting COVID-19 by inhaling coronavirus particles.
The N95 respirator filters the coronavirus particles out of the air they
inhale. If the respirator does not have an exhalation valve, then it will
_also_ filter coronavirus particles out of the air that the wearer _exhales_ as
well.

[**N95 respirators have been in shortage since the start of the pandemic.**](https://www.propublica.org/article/expired-respirators-reused-masks-nurses-in-the-nations-original-covid-19-epicenter-offer-sobering-accounts-of-what-could-come)
Standard medical practice is for medical workers to wear a disposable N95
respirator while treating a sick patient, and for them to _throw away_ that
respirator before treating another patient. Now, medical workers frequently
reuse the same "single-use" N95 respirator for days or weeks on end.

[As of October 27th,](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/27/3m-making-more-n95-masks-than-ever-as-covid-cases-rise.html)
current CDC guidelines ask that members of the general public do not purchase
N95 masks for their own day-to-day use, and instead wear cloth face masks
and/or surgical masks. This is to preserve the supply of disposable N95
respirators for frontline medical workers.

It is still probably unreasonable to expect the general public _not_ to seek
out respirators. As of November 13th, the American health care system is on the
verge of [nationwide collapse](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/11/third-surge-breaking-healthcare-workers/617091/)
due to uncontrolled COVID outbreaks across all 50 states. Members of the
general public should start wearing respirators: both to help protect
themselves from COVID-19 infection, and to reduce the resulting burden on the
nationwide health care system.

The Flexspirator is intended to help fill this gap. It has not been NIOSH
certified, and probably cannot be issued to actual healthcare workers without
violating OSHA regulations, but members of the general public can wear one
_voluntarily,_ and they should be protected from COVID-19 by doing so.

## Protection Offered

**The Flexspirator _should_ offer protection comparable to a reusable N100
respirator.**

This is better than the protection offered by an N95 respirator
and should be sufficient to protect the wearer from inhaling coronavirus
particles while properly worn.

It should also protect the wearer from inhaling any sort of fine particulates,
including smoke, sawdust, metal swarf (from grinding tools), and tear gas.

This is not the same _type_ of protection as offered by a respirator equipped
with (e.g.) P100 + activated carbon filters. Oily aerosols may destroy the
Flexspirator's HEPA filter, rendering it ineffective at filtration. The HEPA
filter will also not absorb chemical fumes, such as from spraypaint or Flex
Seal.

## Basic Construction

The Flexspirator is a slightly modified [Maker Mask Rapid](https://www.makermask.com/rapid-360.html)
printed from [clear PETG](https://www.amazon.com/OVERTURE-Filament-Transparent-Multipack-Dimensional/dp/B08344S1TT)
reinforced with a strong, flexible, rubberized coating of [Swift Response's Flex Seal
Liquid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NygbA9UYPw), the easy way to coat,
seal, and stop leaks fast. It's the super thick rubber that you can pour right
into cracks to stop COVID dead in its tracks.

Flex Seal starts out as a thick liquid and turns into a super strong flexible
rubber. Dipping 3D printed Maker Mask Rapids creates an airtight seal that
lasts for years.  This rubberized coating blocks ingress of contaminated air through
[cracks and holes in the plastic mask frame](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202006.0080/v1)
produced as artifacts of the [FDM printing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fused_filament_fabrication)
process.

In extreme heat or cold, Flex Seal Liquid keeps its hold.

<details>
<summary>
‚ö†DO NOT EXPOSE A FLEXSPIRATOR TO PROLONGED TEMPERATURES OF GREATER THAN 65
DEGREES CELSIUS (149 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT); THIS MAY DEFORM THE PLASTIC.‚ö†
</summary>

A rough lower bound for the [glass transition temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass_transition)
of PETG plastic is 67 degrees Celsius, [according to Wikipedia.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene_terephthalate)

Heating a Flexspirator past the PETG glass transition temperature will probably
cause the plastic to warp and deform.
</details>

Unlike thin paints, Flex Seal Liquid is **ùï§ùï¶ùï°ùïñùï£ ùï•ùïôùïöùïîùïú** and creates a flexible
barrier that's _completely_ airtight. It's like a handyman, in a can!

Flex Seal Liquid is safe around plants and animals, so we used it to seal these
Flexspirators.

**Now with any COVID outbreak, big or small ‚Äì Flex Seal shuts out aerosols!**

To show you the incredible sealing power of Flex Seal Liquid, we made an entire
respirator out of 3D printed PETG plastic, and covered it in Flex Seal Liquid.

After a day of creating irritant smoke clouds, and deliberately huffing them
while wearing a Flexspirator, Flex Seal's airtight barrier takes a beating; and
the HEPA filter, cut from an [ordinary replacement HEPA filter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BWYNZV4/)
for a home air purfiier, stays filtrationally effective.

The inside will not be completely dry, because your breath will tend to
condense on the Flexspirator's inner surface.

<details>
<summary>
‚ö†LIMIT OR AVOID STRENUOUS PHYSICAL ACTIVITY WHILE WEARING A FLEXSPIRATOR
TO AVOID SOAKING THE FILTER WITH MOISTURE FROM YOUR BREATH.‚ö†
</summary>

Physical activity such as intense aerobic exercise requires heavy breathing.
Your breath carries moisture; too much may soak and moisten the HEPA filter
media, and cause it to clog; this will make breathing difficult or impossible,
and may or may not irreparably damage the filter.

If the activity cannot be avoided, be prepared to "hot-swap" the filter
cartridge if it clogs.
</details>

## Basic Usage

### Parts and Components

![Flexspirator parts](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/Yilin-Yang/covid-3d-printing-mi/master/images/flexspirator_parts.png)

The **Top Strap** and **Bottom Strap** secure the Flexspirator against your
face. They can be adjusted by pulling the ends of each strap through the
Slide Buckle, the Loop Buckle, or the Hook Buckle.

The **Hook Buckle** and the **Loop Buckle** on the Bottom Strap fasten
together behind your neck when you don the Flexspirator. This mimics the design
of a conventional reusable elastomeric respirator.

The **Mask Body** is the larger Flexspirator facepiece. It is comprised of
a stiff mask frame of PETG plastic coated on both its interior and exterior
with a silicone rubber coating of Flex Seal Liquid. Along with the Edge Lining,
the Mask Body makes up the **Facepiece** (not labeled).

The **Edge Lining** is the edge of the Flexspirator facepiece where it
contacts your face. It is comprised of [rubber kerf-mount weather stripping](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06Y1SND8X)
coated with Flex Seal Liquid; the weather stripping is soft and can conform to
the wearer's face, while the silicone rubber Flex Seal coating improves its
seal against bare skin.

<details>
<summary>
Earlier Flexspirators used vinyl weather stripping, as specified by the Maker
Mask Rapid's original design.
</summary>

The [vinyl weather stripping](https://www.homedepot.com/p/M-D-Building-Products-1-2-in-x-17-ft-White-Vinyl-Gasket-Weatherstrip-78394/100193598)
was very stiff, making it necessary to cinch the Top Strap and Bottom Strap
uncomfortably tight in order to compress the Edge Lining against the wearer's
face firmly enough to seal.

The new rubber weather stripping is softer and more flexible, and unlike the
vinyl weather stripping, can reliably seal against a person's face even without
a silicone rubber coating of Flex Seal Liquid. Its use also makes the
Flexspirator much more comfortable to wear.
</details>

The **Filter Slot** is the hole into which the Filter Tray is placed. The space
between the Filter Tray and the Filter Slot (not labeled) is the
**Cartridge/Slot Interface**; this must be filled with a **Cartridge/Slot
Interface Sealant**, such as petroleum jelly applied to the lip of the
Filter Tray, to prevent contaminated air from flowing around and bypassing the
filter media.

The **Filter Tray** houses the **Filter Media**, which actually filters air.
The Filter Media is compressed flush against the walls of the Filter Tray by
a plastic **Retaining Ring**. Without this Retaining Ring, the Filter Media may
lift and curl away from the walls of the Filter Tray, creating air gaps, which
may allow contaminated air to bypass the Filter Media.

The **Filter Cover** is functionally a "nut" that screws onto the lip of the
Filter Tray where it protrudes beyond the front of the Flexspirator. It does
not help to filter air, but simply holds the Filter Tray snugly against the
walls of the Filter Slot. We call a Filter Cover screwed onto a Filter Tray
a **Filter Cartridge.**

The **Locking Dimple** is a small divot in the front of the Mask Body. The
Filter Cover has a corresponding **Locking Bump** that seats into the Locking
Dimple when the Filter Cover is screwed onto the Filter Tray, helping to lock
the Filter Cover into place.

### Assembly and Disassembly, Replacing Filter Cartridges

This summarizes the process of loading a new Filter Tray into the Flexspirator.
Removing an already installed Filter Tray is essentially the reverse of
this process.

**1. With the Mask Body cupped in one hand, place a Sealant-coated Filter
Tray into the Filter Slot.**

<img width=50% src="https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/Yilin-Yang/covid-3d-printing-mi/master/images/assembly/1_insert_tray.png" />

**2. Press the Filter Tray firmly into the Filter Slot.**

<img width=50% src="https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/Yilin-Yang/covid-3d-printing-mi/master/images/assembly/2_depress_tray.png" />

If you have just applied petroleum jelly Sealant to the lip of the Filter Tray,
then you should see the excess jelly squeeze out from _all_ sides of the
Cartridge/Slot Interface. If it does not, or if it squeezes out on some sides
but not on others, then remove the Filter Tray and apply more petroleum jelly
where needed.

**3. The lip of the Filter Tray should visibly protrude from the front of the
Mask Body.**

<img width=50% src="https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/Yilin-Yang/covid-3d-printing-mi/master/images/assembly/3_lip_exposed.png" />

During disassembly, you can pop the Filter Tray out of the Filter Slot without
getting petroleum jelly on your hands by striking the exposed lip of the Filter
Tray with the Filter Cover.

**4. Place a Filter Cover over the lip of the Filter Tray as pictured so that
the "nubs" of the Filter Cover point toward 11 o'clock and 5 o'clock
positions.**

<img width=50% src="https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/Yilin-Yang/covid-3d-printing-mi/master/images/assembly/4_place_filter_cover.png" />

**5. Grip the nubs of the Filter Tray.**

<img width=50% src="https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/Yilin-Yang/covid-3d-printing-mi/master/images/assembly/5_grip_cover.png" />

**6. Twist the Filter Tray clockwise, as viewed from the front of the Mask
Body, until the Locking Bump slides into the Locking Dimple.**

<img width=50% src="https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/Yilin-Yang/covid-3d-printing-mi/master/images/assembly/6_twist_cover.png" />

You may hear or feel the Locking Bump click into place. If the Locking Bump
does not fit into the Locking Dimple because the Locking Dimple is packed with
Flex Seal, then you may scrape out the excess Flex Seal with a small pick or
knife.

**Do NOT** twist the Filter Cover so that the Locking Bump moves _past_ the
Locking Dimple. This may damage the lip of the Filter Tray.

It is possible for the Locking Bump to break off of the Filter Cover. In this
case, the Filter Cover can still be used, but may not hold the Filter Tray as
solidly. Note that Filter Covers are fully interchangeable, so a Filter Cover
from a replacement Filter Cartridge can replace a broken Filter Cover without
issue.

### Maintenance

Protect the Flexspirator from damage so that it can still maintain an
airtight seal against the wearer's face when worn.

The seal may be compromised by:

1. _Physical damage to_ OR _manufacturing defects in_ the plastic mask frame,
resulting in micro- or macro-scale cracks and holes.
2. _Peeling_ or _perforation_ of the Flex Seal coating.
3. _Pinhole leaks_ in the _filter cartridge/slot sealant_, which may allow air to
bypass the HEPA filter media by passing between the filter tray and the filter
slot.

Even the plastic mask frame should be largely airtight by
itself. This creates protective redundancy: both (1) and (2) must occur at the
same spot on the mask's surface for the walls of the mask to spring a leak.
To check for such leaks, conduct an **Integrity Test** as described below.

Of course, tears, punctures, or other forms of damage to the Filter Media can
make it ineffective at filtration. Actual holes would allow contaminants to
bypass the filter, for instance, or destroy the mesh of fine fibers in the
Filter Media that would actually trap contaminants. Take care to avoid damage
to the Filter Media when cleaning, disinfecting, or wearing the Flexspirator.

#### Avoiding Damage to the Filter Media

_When researching how to work with HEPA filter media, I used [this link](https://smartairfilters.com/en/blog/hepa-filters-make-diy-face-masks-covid-coronavirus/)
as an informational reference._

The Filter Media is cut from an ordinary replacement [HEPA
filter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BWYNZV4/) for a household air
purifier. It consists of a stiff, "papery" structural layer of PET fibers that
supports a thin, extremely delicate "tissue" of polypropylene (PP) fibers. The PP
fibers are the "actual" filter media that would trap contaminants like
coronavirus particles. The PET backing provides some filtration, but this is
probably incidental, and for safety we should assume that the filter media is
ineffective without an intact PP "tissue".

<img width=50% src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23268616/100191420-12435a80-2ebe-11eb-92f6-153ad247474e.png" />

HEPA filters intended for actual use are typically pleated, i.e. folded like an
accordion, to maximize the surface area of filter media in which contaminants
can be trapped. In filters like the [Honeywell replacement filter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BWYNZV4/)
that I cut apart for Filter Media, each individual fold of the "accordion" is
supported by strips of thick glue from the fold underneath.

<img width=50% src="https://github.com/Yilin-Yang/covid-3d-printing-mi/blob/master/images/labeled_cartridge.jpg?raw=true" />

If you need to remove the Filter Media from a Filter Tray, then _after_
removing the Retaining Ring, you can use a thin object (like a screwdriver) to
push the Filter Media out of the tray, pressing the object's tip into a glue
strip, avoiding damage to the PP "tissue". You should also be careful to
unstick the glue strips from the inner surface of the Filter Tray "lip", if
applicable, so that the PP "tissue" does not rip as the Filter Media is removed
from the Filter Tray.

To protect the Filter Media from damage and preserve its effectiveness
at filtration:

- **Do NOT** prod or scratch at the soft, felt-like "tissue" in the Filter Tray
- **Do NOT** soak or splash the Filter Media with water or other liquids
- **Do NOT** expose the Filter Media to soaps or disinfectants
- **Do NOT** expose the Filter Media to oily, sticky, tarry, or resinous aerosols, such as
  from blowing cigarette smoke through the Filter Media

#### Avoiding Structural Damage to the Plastic Mask Body

The Flexspirator is reasonably durable and will comfortably survive _ordinary_
rough handling, but extreme mishandling can snap, break, or deform the
underlying plastic mask frame. **Forms of mishandling that may break the plastic
mask body include:**

- Stepping on a Flexspirator _with_ your body weight
- Striking a Flexspirator sharply with a claw hammer
- Stowing a Flexspirator in a cramped book bag with heavy textbooks
- Exposing a Flexspirator to prolonged temperatures over 65 degrees Celsius
(149 degrees Fahrenheit)

The following will **probably NOT cause structural damage** to a
Flexspirator:

- Hurling a Flexpirator into a drywall from five meters distance
- Crashing face-first into a sliding glass door while wearing a Flexspirator

#### Avoiding Damage to the Flex Seal Coating

Flex Seal Liquid costs around $90 per gallon. Based on preliminary estimates,
it takes approximately $5 of Flex Seal Liquid to coat a Flexspirator. The
coating is made as thin as possible to maximize the number of Flexspirators
that can be constructed from a single bucket of Flex Seal Liquid; and for
cosmetic reasons, like avoiding bubbles and blobs.

The coating of cured Flex Seal Liquid will most likely peel and rip:

- Near the edges of the coating, where the cured Flex Seal gives way to
uncovered plastic.
- On the surface of the flexible vinyl weather stripping; too much
deformation of the weather stripping can overstress the Flex Seal and make it
tear.

The Flex Seal coating will **probably be damaged** by:

- Scraping with a metal fork or knife
- Scraping the Flexspirator against an abrasive surface with pressure, as by
forcibly scrubbing the Flexspirator against a bare brick wall

The Flex Seal coating will **probably _NOT_ be damaged** by:

- Rubbing or picking with your hands, unless you are picking at existing tears
or the edges of the coating
- Scrubbing with the scouring pad of a kitchen sponge, even one that isn't safe
for non-stick pans
- Rubbing against the spiral metal ring binding of a loose-leaf notebook while
in a book bag

#### Maintaining the Filter Cartridge/Slot Sealant

This section explains the purpose of the petroleum jelly Sealant in the
Flexspirator design, how to maintain it, and how to reapply it when necessary.

Imprecision in the process of 3D printing would prevent a perfect airtight seal
at the Cartridge/Slot Interface, i.e. between the plastic of the Filter Slot
and the Filter Tray. Without that seal, contaminated air may flow _around_ the
Filter Tray, bypassing the Filter Media entirely. We apply a Cartridge/Slot
Interface Sealant to fill these air gaps. In principle, many materials could be
used as Sealant, but we recommend common household petroleum jelly.

Gaps in the petroleum jelly Sealant may permit contaminated air to bypass the
Filter Media. This risk can be cheaply mitigated by applying _generous_ amounts
of petroleum jelly as Sealant, increasing the volume of jelly that would need
to be displaced to produce a leak.

<img width=50% src="https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/Yilin-Yang/covid-3d-printing-mi/master/images/placing_jelly.png" />

You can apply a coating of Cartridge/Slot Interface Sealant simply by smearing
_generous_ quantities of petroleum jelly on the lip of a Filter Tray with
a Q-tip. As you press the Filter Tray into the Filter Slot, petroleum jelly
should squeeze out from the Cartridge/Slot Interface.

<img width=50% src="https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/Yilin-Yang/covid-3d-printing-mi/master/images/assembly/2_depress_tray.png" />

**You should reapply the petroleum jelly Sealant after:**

- Switching Filter Cartridges, if the lip of the new Filter Tray has not
  been coated with petroleum jelly.
- Washing the Flexspirator, e.g. in a kitchen sink, with a sponge and
  dish soap. Actions like this will wash away petroleum jelly.
- Removing and reinserting the same Filter Tray more than a half-dozen times
  without any reapplication of petroleum jelly.
- Seeing that the petroleum jelly is visibly dirty.
- Hearing a hissing sound from the Filter Cartridge when inhaling that does not
  sound like regular air movement, OR, Feeling a thin jet of "cold air" on your
  face inside the Mask Body that seems to come from the Cartridge/Slot Interface.

To "refresh" the Interface Sealant in between reapplications of petroleum
jelly, you can insert the Filter Tray into the Filter Slot and then "smear" the
excess petroleum jelly around the back edges of the Filter Tray. This is
usually sufficient to seal pinhole leaks when both the Filter Slot and Filter
Tray have existing coatings of petroleum jelly.

<img width=50% src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yilin-Yang/covid-3d-printing-mi/master/images/smooth_jelly.jpg" />

Excess petroleum jelly that spills onto other parts of the Mask Body interior
can be wiped away without issue.

### Seal and Integrity Check

This section explains how to don a Flexspirator and then perform a seal check.
It also explains how to perform an integrity check, which is extremely similar
to a seal check.

#### Performing a Seal Check or Integrity Check

You should perform a **seal check** after donning a Flexspirator, to make sure
that the Edge Lining has sealed properly against your face. To perform a seal
check, don a Flexspirator already loaded with a Filter Cartridge, tightly cover
the front of the Flexspirator ("smothering" the Filter Cover) with your hand,
and try to inhale or exhale. Your hand will probably not completely block air
movement through the Filter Cartridge, but it should _reduce_ it; you should
notice the Flexspirator "suck in" against your face when inhaling, or "bulging
out" against your hand when exhaling. If the Flexspirator does not "suck in" or
"bulge out", then the seal check has failed.

<details>
<summary>
‚ö†A SUCCESSFUL SEAL CHECK DETECTS OBVIOUS PROBLEMS, BUT DOES NOT NECESSARILY
MEAN THAT THE CARTRIDGE/SLOT INTERFACE HAS BEEN PROPERLY SEALED.‚ö†
</summary>

Small leaks, like pinhole leaks in the Cartridge/Slot Interface Sealant, may
not be noticeable during a seal check.
</details>

You can perform an **integrity check** by following the same procedure as
a seal check, except that you should don the Flexspirator with the Filter
Cartridge _removed,_ i.e. with the Filter Slot completely empty. This should
allow you to fully plug the front of the Flexspirator with your hand, making it
entirely airtight. If you try to inhale or exhale, you should feel _no_ air
movement _whatsoever_ through the Flexspirator. If you feel air movement, then
the integrity check has failed.

The following are illustrations of the basic process of conducting a seal check
or an integrity check.

**1. Pull the Top Strap over the crown of your head.**

<img width=50% src="https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/Yilin-Yang/covid-3d-printing-mi/master/images/seal_check/1_top_strap.png" />

**2. Adjust the Top Strap, securing the upper half of the Flexspirator against
your face and nose.**

<img width=50% src="https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/Yilin-Yang/covid-3d-printing-mi/master/images/seal_check/2_top_strap_adjust.png" />

Use both hands to grab separate ends of the Top Strap. Pull outward, to lift
the Slide Buckle away from the scalp, so that the Top Strap does not snag your
hair during adjustment.

**3. Fasten the Hook Buckle and Loop Buckle behind your neck.**

<img width=50% src="https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/Yilin-Yang/covid-3d-printing-mi/master/images/seal_check/3_bottom_strap_hook.png" />

**4. Adjust the Lower Strap, securing the lower half of the Flexspirator
against your cheeks and chin.**

<img width=50% src="https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/Yilin-Yang/covid-3d-printing-mi/master/images/seal_check/4_bottom_strap_adjust.png" />

**5. Press your hand into the front of the Flexspirator and inhale or exhale,
to see if the Mask Body "sucks in" or "bulges out", respectively.**

<img width=50% src="https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/Yilin-Yang/covid-3d-printing-mi/master/images/seal_check/5_seal_check.png" />

#### Implications of Failing a Seal Check

If a seal check fails, then the Flexspirator will not protect you as you are
currently wearing it. **Do not wear the Flexspirator in a hazardous environment
if you are not able to pass a seal check.**

Performing a seal check helps you to detect _obvious_ problems with the seal
of a Flexspirator. These might be large cracks and holes in the Facepiece that
contaminated air can penetrate; or the Flexspirator may not
[fit](https://www.osha.gov/video/respiratory_protection/fittesting_transcript.html)
properly; or the Flexspirator may not be seated properly on your face.

Large cracks and holes in the Flexspirator will need to be repaired. This is
probably most easily done by painting the broken area with a new coating of
Flex Seal Liquid and allowing it to cure in a well-ventilated space for 24-48 hours.
[32 oz. cans of Flex Seal Liquid](https://www.homedepot.com/p/FLEX-SEAL-FAMILY-OF-PRODUCTS-Flex-Seal-Liquid-White-32-oz-Liquid-Rubber-Sealant-Coating-LFSWHTR32/301711550)
are typically available at Home Depot for $30; this is enough to repair
dozens or hundreds of broken Flexspirators, so if Flexspirators are being
worn by your colleagues or neighbors, then you can pool your money to buy
a single can for your collective use.

You may be able to fix the Flexspirator's seal by adjusting the Mask Body's
position on your face, or loosening/tightening the Top Strap and Bottom Strap
as needed.

If the Flexspirator does not fit properly ‚Äì meaning that, no matter how you
adjust it, there are still air gaps between the Edge Lining and your face
‚Äì then you may try to fill those gaps with [**Duct Seal**](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Gardner-Bender-1-lb-Plug-Duct-Seal-Compound-DS-110/100212441),
a cheap dough-like material akin to [Blu Tack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blu_Tack)
used to fill "gaps and holes" in ductwork.

#### Implications of Failing an Integrity Check

**If an integrity check fails, then contaminated air will be able to penetrate
the Flexspirator without passing through the Filter Media.** The Flexspirator
may still provide better protection than a cloth face mask or surgical mask,
but will no longer reliably provide N100 or even N95 protection unless it is
repaired.

An integrity check is similar to a seal check, but it only tests for leaks in
the Facepiece. Because no Filter Cartridge is loaded when conducting an
integrity check, this check is useful mainly for testing damaged Flexspirators
to see if they can still be safely worn, or to see if attempted repairs were
successful.
