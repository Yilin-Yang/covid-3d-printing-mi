# COVID-19 PPE 3D Printing Resources (Michigan)

I'm using a GitHub repo as a file server/static site web host for files and
other materials useful for making or using 3D printed PPE.

If you're here to download files, then I'd recommend downloading "manually" by
clicking on the filename in the repo dashboard above, and then clicking
"Download" in the header bar (next to "History"). The files are stored with Git
LFS, so `git clone` from a terminal won't work correctly unless you have
[Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) installed.


## Where do I donate?

**If you're 3D printing ear savers, then it would actually be helpful if you
could send them to me.** I've set up an [ear saver request form](https://forms.gle/NtTunTbEoFRqz1C7A)
for individuals and small groups, but I actually blew through my entire ear
saver stockpile after the first night of the form being open.ðŸ˜… Shoot me a  DM
on Facebook or an email (yiliny@umich.edu) if you'd like to donate, but need my
mailing address! **If you donate, please label your ear savers with the type of
plastic from which they were printed (PLA, PETG, ABS, etc.)!** This is normally
done by writing something like "PETG" on the plastic with a metallic Sharpie,
but you could also include a note that says "these are all PLA" or similar.

Alternatively, and also if you're in Michigan, I recommend donating to
[Operation Face Shield](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1123320618008506/).
They're among the largest volunteer organizations for making and distributing 3D
printed PPE, they have several drop-off points (most in Ann Arbor, but also in
neighboring cities), and they have a far-reaching distribution network (mostly
in Michigan, but there's a pilot in the group who can make plane deliveries.
Outside of Southeast Michigan, Operation Face Shield has sent shipments to the
Upper Peninsula, Nebraska, and the Navajo Nation, among others.

## What should I donate?

**As of the time of writing, you no longer need to 3D print faceshield
headbands.** A member of Operation Face Shield donated an injection mold for
faceshield headbands: using that mold, they can now manufacture ~1500 face
shields per day, which is orders of magnitude more than can be practically
manufactured by 3D printing. For comparison, it takes roughly 22 hours for
a single 3D printer to finish printing eight.

**Instead, I'd recommend printing "ear savers",** because that's what I'm
(personally) short on right now. Operation Face Shield also has a large
stockpile of these (as of the time of writing, they've announced that
we can pause our printing of ear savers), and I might actually ask them if I can
pick up a few boxes.

## Files

- [`ear_saver_thinn`](./ear_saver_thinn.stl) is the original STL provided by
  Operation Face Shield for its volunteers.
- [`ear_saver_thicc`](./ear_saver_thicc.stl) is a slightly modified version
  with a thicker band (1.5mm, rather than 1mm).
